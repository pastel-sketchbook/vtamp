# vtamp for Android

A native Kotlin / Jetpack Compose app for Android 10 and later phones. It
browses your vtamp Library and plays its files on the phone, with its own
queue. It never changes the server's playback or Queue. The server and app
use HTTP protocol **14**; the Android app version is independently **0.1.0**.

## Connect

Start the server with its app API enabled:

```sh
vtamp server start --api tailscale
vtamp server start --headless --api tailscale  # Linux, or no audio device
```

In **Settings**, enter `100.x.y.z:8700`, a MagicDNS name with its port, or the
`api_url` from `vtamp server start --json`. HTTP(S) URLs ending in `/api` also
work; HTTPS is for a TLS proxy in front of vtamp. The server itself provides
neither authentication nor TLS. Use a private network such as Tailscale.

Changing to another server clears this phone's playback and queue only after
the new connection succeeds. Failed connection attempts leave the old server
available. Replies from an old server or search are discarded.

## Screens

- **Library:** title/artist/album search, All/Audio/Video/Radio filters, 200
  tracks per page. Tap to insert after the current track and play immediately;
  the rest of the queue stays. The row menu offers Play Next and Add to Queue.
- **Queue:** This Phone has individual entry identities, including duplicates;
  use each row's menu to move up/down or remove. Clear asks before stopping
  playback. Server is read-only; selecting an entry copies that queue and
  starts there on the phone. A revision change during pagination retries the
  snapshot once instead of mixing two queues.
- **Import:** only appears when the server offers yt-dlp. Paste a YouTube URL
  with the native text menu, optionally select Whole playlist, Start/End and
  Save video (up to 480p). Times accept seconds, M:SS or H:MM:SS. Successful
  submission clears the draft and resets video saving off; failure retains it.
  Recent jobs load 20 at a time, with Cancel, Retry and Play. Retry preserves
  the original job's options on the server. Legacy protocol-14 servers use
  their bounded `imports` history instead of the cursor API.
- **Settings:** server connection/status and third-party licenses.

The mini player opens Now Playing. It offers cover/video, seek, previous,
play/pause, next, shuffle and repeat. Use the phone's volume buttons to adjust
volume. Playback controls stay anchored below the artwork and metadata; title
and subtitle each reserve two lines, with longer text ellipsized. Artwork shrinks
on shorter screens; with large system text, its section can scroll while the
playback controls remain visible. Shuffle preserves the
visible order and visits every queue entry once per pass. Play Next takes
priority even during shuffle. Repeat cycles off/all/one; repeat-one affects
natural endings only. Previous restarts a file after three seconds, otherwise
returns through playback history. The system media controls select the output
route (for example Bluetooth); there is no Chromecast integration.

Music continues with the app in the background and while the screen is locked.
The foreground media service owns playback, and the notification/lock screen
and headset controls use the same queue policy as the app. Removing a playing
app from Recents leaves its service playing. Force Stop, Android's active-app
Stop, or process termination ends playback. Audio focus handles interruptions;
headphone disconnection pauses. There is no phone-call permission.

Only the server address, shuffle/repeat settings and Cover/Video choice persist.
A new process starts with an empty queue and never starts playback by itself.
Imports poll while the app is visible, independently of the selected tab (one
second with live jobs, otherwise ten seconds). Job completion refreshes Library.
The server continues imports while the app is closed. Failed older pages retain
their cursor and offer retry. An uncertain submission is not automatically sent
again; refresh recent imports before deciding whether to repeat it.

## Audio and saved video

Files are streamed from track-ID URLs with HTTP Range support. AAC, MP3,
FLAC, WAV, Ogg Vorbis/Opus use Media3 and platform decoders. ALAC uses the bundled
FFmpeg decoder. There is no offline download or server loudness correction.
Radio connects directly to its registered URL (including HLS), not through the
server. Each connection resolves redirects and checks the response type and
final URL before selecting HLS or ordinary audio playback, so station gateway
URLs without a `.m3u8` suffix also work. Resolved URLs, including temporary
tokens, are never saved; resume and reconnect resolve the registered URL again.
Pause or a track change cancels any pending connection. Radio has no seek slider
or natural queue advancement. Pause disconnects;
resume joins the live broadcast. Network disconnects retry after 1, 2, 4, 8, 16,
then 30 seconds, cancelled by pause/clear/track changes. Unsupported streams
pause with an error.

Saved video reads the server's silent Matroska sidecar without transcoding or
remuxing. H.264, HEVC, VP9 and AV1 depend on available device decoders; an
unsupported or missing video falls back to the cover and leaves audio playing.
Video uses a SurfaceView so Android can handle HDR color and brightness through
its display compositor; TextureView can produce dark or corrupted colors for
10-bit HDR files. HDR decoding and display support still depend on the device.
A separate video ExoPlayer follows the audio clock; synchronization never seeks,
slows or pauses audio. Cover selection, closing the player, screen locking or
backgrounding releases video decoding and its network source. On return, the
last picture remains until a frame catches up to current audio time. Surface
snapshots are copied asynchronously with PixelCopy; if the surface has already
gone away, the cover is shown instead. Old copies cannot replace a new track's
picture. Each queue entry replaces both the displayed surface and its video
player, including Next
and consecutive copies of the same track. Startup and rebuffering catch up by
adjusting video speed; they do not repeatedly seek and flush the decoder. Video
that runs ahead waits for audio. Explicit seeks, a paused-frame correction and
repeat-one align video directly to the audio position. The full
player can expand video to landscape. Entering and leaving fullscreen moves
the existing video view and retains its prepared player and buffered media;
it does not reopen the source or seek to catch up again. Tablet-specific layouts,
Android Auto and Picture-in-Picture are not part of this release.

## Build and install

Requirements: JDK 17 or newer compatible with Gradle 8.13 (local verification
also uses JDK 23), Python 3, curl, make, and the Android SDK. Set `ANDROID_HOME`
to its root. Install these build packages with the Android SDK manager:

```sh
sdkmanager 'platforms;android-36' 'build-tools;36.0.0' \
  'ndk;29.0.13113456' 'cmake;3.22.1'
android/scripts/build-decoder.sh
cd android
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest lintDebug assembleDebug
adb -s YOUR_DEVICE install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

The first decoder build downloads checksum-verified Media3 1.8.0 and FFmpeg
6.1.4 source archives. The Media3 archive is large because upstream includes
its test media; only the decoder module is extracted. All downloads and native
outputs stay in ignored `Vendor/`. It builds ALAC only for ARMv7, ARM64 and
x86_64, without GPL/nonfree components, encoders or FFmpeg network/demux code.
Native libraries are checked for 16KB ELF segment alignment. Gradle refuses to
build an APK missing any decoder ABI. `VTAMP_BUILD_JOBS` controls native build
parallelism (default 4).

The Gradle Wrapper distribution and dependencies are pinned. Android Studio
can open this directory directly. `local.properties`, keystores, SDK downloads,
APKs, build directories and Gradle caches must not be committed. The debug APK
is signed with the local SDK debug key and can be installed directly. Preserve
that key for upgrade installs; debug builds from another machine may require
uninstalling the old copy. Store publishing and production signing are separate.

FFmpeg's LGPL license, upstream source links and rebuild/relink instructions
are part of the source and the in-app **Licenses** screen. When distributing an
APK, provide the corresponding source and build/relink materials with it. The
app is open source: replacing the decoder and rebuilding/re-signing is allowed.
The bundled JNI adapter and Android libraries carry their respective notices.

## Tests

```sh
cd android
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest lintDebug assembleDebug
./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest  # an isolated API 29+ emulator
```

Run the unqualified Gradle tasks above, as CI does: `:app:lintDebug` alone omits
the bundled decoder module's lint checks. The decoder wrapper's `lint.xml` opts
into the pinned Media3 release's `UnstableApi`; downloaded upstream
sources are not patched, and lint remains enabled for both modules.

Unit tests use the same JSON fixtures as the iPhone app, plus a deterministic
queue and HTTP stubs. Device tests run against their own synthetic MockWebServer
inside the emulator, with muted audio. They exercise UI imports, local queues,
background playback, radio redirects and disconnect/resume, cancellation during
station resolution, video suspension/catch-up,
fullscreen continuity, and actual AAC/ALAC/WAV/H.264/VP9 decoding. They never
submit imports or commands to a personal server. CI configures API 29 and API 36
emulator runs. SDK setup explicitly selects `platform-tools` to avoid the retired
`tools` package; the pinned platform, build tools, NDK and CMake are installed
in the following step. An unexecuted CI job is not local validation.
Video tests wait for readable decoded pixels before capturing a surface and
sample both playback clocks on the main thread when checking synchronization.
The synchronization tolerance stays at 250 ms, including on slower CI emulators.

`src/androidTest/assets/resume-h264.mkv` is a synthetic MIT-licensed test pattern,
not personal footage. It is 60 seconds, 160×90 at 10 fps, with eight-second GOPs:

```sh
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i testsrc2=size=160x90:rate=10 -t 60 -c:v libx264 \
  -preset veryfast -crf 35 -g 80 -bf 0 -pix_fmt yuv420p -an resume-h264.mkv
```

`src/androidTest/assets/radio-tone.aac` is a synthetic four-second 440 Hz tone
used as the segment of a local HLS radio fixture:

```sh
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i 'sine=frequency=440:sample_rate=48000:duration=4' \
  -c:a aac -b:a 32k -f adts radio-tone.aac
```

For an explicitly authorized read-only live check, a **debug** build accepts:

```sh
adb -s YOUR_EMULATOR shell am start \
  -n com.xrath.vtamp.android/com.xrath.vtamp.MainActivity \
  --es VTAMP_SERVER http://SERVER:8700/api --ez VTAMP_MUTED true
```

This opens the real app; it does not seed or mutate the server. Use a separate
isolated server for live import testing. Emulator playback/position assertions
prove neither audible output nor physical Bluetooth/headphone behavior. Device
codec support varies; never infer all AV1/HEVC phones from emulator results.
